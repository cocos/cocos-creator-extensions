# Shader Graph

## Background

In order to lower the threshold for Shader development and expand the capabilities of procedural generation, and to encourage artists/technical artists to directly produce materials in Cocos Creator instead of third-party Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools, avoiding additional development work when importing materials, we have introduced a node-based material editor specifically designed for Cocos Creator.

This plugin relies on Cocos Creator version 3.8.2 and is developed based on our in-house open-source [Graph component](https://github.com/itharbors/ui/tree/main/element/graph) from the Web UI library.

To promote collaboration and innovation within the developer community, we have open-sourced the full set of source code for this plugin under the MIT license. This means developers are free to use, modify, and distribute this tool. We hope this project inspires more creativity within the community, and encourage everyone to contribute to the improvement of this tool by submitting pull requests.

### Basic Structure

## Preparation Phase

1. Download Cocos Creator 3.8.2 editor and the shader-graph.zip plugin.
2. Open Cocos Creator 3.8.2 editor, go to the main menu, select **Extensions/Extension Manager** to open the Extensions panel.
3. Click <img src="readme/导入扩展文件.png" width="200px">, choose the **shader-graph.zip** extension file, and import it.
4. Restart the editor (Currently, for version 3.8.2, a restart is required to ensure the registration of **.shadergraph** assets. In future versions >= 3.8.3, this process will be improved, and a restart may not be necessary).

## Creating Asset

1. Right-click in the **Assets** panel, select **Create/Shader Graph** to create a **.shadergraph** asset.
   - Surface (Surface Shader)
   - Unlit (Unlit Shader)
2. Double-click the asset to enter the editing panel.
3. <img src="readme/创建后的资源.png" width="200px">

## How to Apply to Your Project

1. Create a new Material asset or select an existing one.
2. In the Inspector panel, locate the Effect property, and then click to choose the effect with the same name as the .shadergraph asset.
